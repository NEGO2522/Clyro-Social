## 🚩 Problem
Event memories are scattered across Instagram, WhatsApp, and other platforms, making it hard for participants to relive the event as one shared story.

## 💡 Solution
**Evently** is a social app for events.  
- Organizers create event pages.  
- Participants join via code/QR.  
- Everyone uploads photos/videos to a shared feed.  
- Events can be public or private.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
